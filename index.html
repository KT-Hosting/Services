    <td>As interest rates rise many investors find themselves in a difficult position, with mortgage payments costing more than in previous years. Many neutral and positive properties have slipped into the negative. 
People’s pay checks are going to the banks to pay mortgages over their future and in some cases the food on their table. 
Short term rental platforms can offer an attractive alternative with higher nightly rates, but between all the additional time, knowledge and effort required to make these platforms beneficial most people don’t want to pick up the additional job that hosting on these sights can be.
